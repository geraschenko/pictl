/*
 * One-producer/one-consumer bridge from pushed values to `for await`. This
 * file is repo-agnostic and consumed verbatim by the consuming repo's sync
 * script; it deliberately has no imports at all.
 */

/**
 * The event source every stream consumer pulls from; see driver.ts.
 *
 * The two end-states are distinct. `close()` is the producer saying "no more
 * values" — whatever is already queued is still delivered. `cancel()` is the
 * consumer saying "I'm done" — queued values are dropped.
 *
 * The hard requirement is that the consumer can cancel *while parked on
 * `next()`*: runStream cancels from a quiet or deadline timer that fires
 * while its pump awaits the next event. That rules out the two obvious
 * off-the-shelf answers, both verified by experiment:
 *
 *   - An async generator. `return()` on a generator suspended at an `await`
 *     (rather than at a `yield`) is queued behind the pending `next()` and
 *     never settles, so cancellation hangs until an event happens to arrive.
 *   - A `node:stream` Readable in object mode. Same hang on `return()`, and
 *     `destroy()` makes subsequent iteration throw ERR_STREAM_PREMATURE_CLOSE
 *     instead of ending cleanly.
 *
 * `events.on()` and the `it-pushable` package do both satisfy the semantics;
 * they are not used because this is 40 lines with no dependency, and because
 * neither names the close/cancel distinction that matters here.
