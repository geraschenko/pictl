/*
 * The generic driver for socket stream consumers: streaming is intrinsically
 * a fold — each event updates state, emits output, and decides whether to
 * stop, in one step. The fold itself lives in the socket client, which
 * delivers each event paired with its post-fold state; the pairing is
 * load-bearing — with async handlers the client's live state can run ahead
 * of the event being processed, so handlers must judge each event against
 * the state snapshot taken when it was dispatched, not the current one.
 *
 * This file is repo-agnostic and consumed verbatim by the consuming repo's
 * sync script: it may import only other synced files (until-engine.ts). The
 * event type `TEvent` and session-state type `TState` are parameters,
 * instantiated over the consuming repo's socket event and session state.
 */

/**
 * Subscribe on `client` and drive `handler` over the pushed (event, state)
 * pairs. Contract:
 * - `onSeed` runs exactly once, before any `onEvent`; pairs dispatched
 *   before the subscribe promise settles are queued and processed after it.
 * - Events are queued FIFO and processed strictly one handler call at a time
 *   (handlers may issue RPCs; a second event must not start processing while
 *   one is in flight). Each is judged against its own state snapshot, and a
 *   satisfying event is always emitted before the stream stops.
 * - First settlement wins; after it, queued and later events are dropped and
 *   both timers are cleared on every path — a pending timer is an active
 *   handle that keeps node's event loop (and thus the CLI process) alive
 *   until it fires, even though the losing promise is discarded.
 * - Both timers arm after `onSeed` resolves false — seed satisfaction takes
 *   precedence, and connection/subscribe latency never counts against the
 *   deadline. The quiet timer resets as each handler call completes.
 *   Deadline expiry rejects with UntilTimeoutError, taking precedence on
 *   ties.
 * - Exceptions thrown by hooks reject the returned promise; they must not
 *   escape into the socket's data listener.
 * - Socket close settles "closed" once the in-flight handler call (if any)
 *   completes; queued events behind it are dropped. Close before the seed
 *   rejects — there is no state to resolve with.
